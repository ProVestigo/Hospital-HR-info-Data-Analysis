# Hospital-HR-info-Data-Analysis
This is a project that satisfies the following request of an imagined HR boss who wants specific information on the employees of a large hospital.


"The HR boss wants to delve into the metrics of the two employee groups: those who left the company and those who still work for us. You decided to present the information in a table.

The HR boss asks for the following metrics:

the median number of projects the employees in a group worked on, and how many employees worked on more than five projects;
the mean and median time spent in the company;
the share of employees who've had work accidents;
the mean and standard deviation of the last evaluation score.
Remember that the guy from HR asks for those metrics for two different groups!"
